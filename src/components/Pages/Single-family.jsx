Look for properties in desirable areas with good schools, low crime rates, and easy access to amenities.</p>
                                        <p> <span className='text-black font-14 letter-spacing-1 font-weight-600'>Condition of the property: </span>The condition of the property can have a big impact on its value and potential for rental income.
