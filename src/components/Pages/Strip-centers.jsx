                                    The location of the property is one of the most important factors for investors. Properties located in high-traffic areas with good visibility, accessibility, and convenience are more likely to attract tenants and customers, which can drive up rents and property values.</p>

                                    The success of a strip center or retail center depends on the tenant mix. Investors should aim to attract a diverse range of tenants, including anchor tenants and smaller retail shops, to provide a variety of products and services that can appeal to a broad customer base. A well-curated tenant mix can help to reduce vacancy rates and boost rental income.</p>
